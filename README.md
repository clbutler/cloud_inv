# cloud_inv

This is a working project developed by Chris Butler, starting on the 
25/01/2025 

Background:

A cloud inversion is a meteological event characterised by being able to 
look down upon cloud formations. The phenomenum typically occurs due to  
temperature inversions, where higher 
altitude are associated with higher, rather than lower, temperatures. In 
short, this warm 'lid' can trap colder air below, including that of 
clouds and fog. For some excellent photos of such occurence please see

Goals:
Whilst observating a cloud inversion can occur at relatively low altitude, 
Scotland makes an excellent place to sight such weather, in part  due to 
being the home of 282 Munros, mountains of a 
height greater than 3000 
feet. Named after the explorer Sir Hugh Munro, climbing these peaks 
represents a popular challenge for outdoor enthusiasts. Whilst 
representing beauty in their own routes, the pairing of climbing a 
munro with observing a cloud inversion represents a potetentially magical 
moment for those fortunate enough to witness. 

However, currently knowing when and whether a cloud inversion is likely to 
occur represents something of a mystery. This sofware hopes to address 
this by providing (i) a map of all 282 Munro 
locations across Scotland (ii) a live RAG (red, amber, green) rating of 
how likely a cloud inversion is likely to occur on a particular date, 
drawing in latest weather prediction from XXXXX
